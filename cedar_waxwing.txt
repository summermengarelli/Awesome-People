The cedar waxwing is my spark bird. Your spark bird is the bird that captivated you and caused you to become interested in birding. In college I took a field ornithology class and the entire semester I wanted to see a 
cedar waxwing -- just one! I didn't know at the time that this species is social, so I was totally shocked when, on the very last day of class, we went to our college's field station and I saw a tree entirely covered in cedar waxwings.
